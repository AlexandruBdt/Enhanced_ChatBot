Chatbot with Knowledge Base
Description
This is a simple Python-based chatbot that can answer user queries by matching them with stored questions and answers in a JSON file. 
The bot can also learn new answers from users and store them for future reference. It utilizes the difflib module to find the closest matching question from the knowledge base.

Features
Load and Save Knowledge Base: The chatbot loads its knowledge base from a JSON file and saves any updates after each session.
Answer Retrieval: Finds and retrieves answers based on user input, providing relevant responses from the stored knowledge base.
Learning Capability: If the bot doesn't know the answer, it prompts the user to teach it by providing a new answer for the question, which is then saved.
Match Detection: Utilizes difflib.get_close_matches to find the closest question match, enhancing the bot's ability to handle similar or slightly different questions.

Future Development
NLP Integration: Enhance the bot with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to better understand and respond to user queries.
Persistent Storage: Implement a more robust database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB) for storing questions and answers instead of a simple JSON file.
GUI Interface: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction and make it more accessible for non-technical users.
Contextual Understanding: Add functionality to maintain conversation context to allow more meaningful interactions beyond simple question-answering.
Multi-Language Support: Extend the chatbot to support multiple languages for a broader user base.
